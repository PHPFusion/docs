This is where you add Administrators to your site, you assign rights to them so that they can access certain, or all, parts of the Administration and specific Infusions.

You can promote any member you want to the position of Administrator.
Administrators have increased access, especially in Forums where they automatically have full moderator access.

You can set which parts of the Administration section that they can have access to.
Choose carefully, it is a good idea only to allow an Administrator access to sections that they would need to carry out their duties.
You should try to minimize the number of people who have full access for security reasons.
Administrators elevated to Super Administrator level have full access to all sections.

Tick the boxes of the sections you want to allow access,and then click Save Admin Rights when done.

Some areas are more security related than others, so only give access for these areas to people you trust. E.g.; Custom Pages, Panels, Database Backup.
