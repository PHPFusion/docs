# Custom Pages

A Custom Page is created from the Administration with our Basic formatting editor or with TinyMCE.

Custom Pages can be very powerful when it comes to customizing content to your PHPFusion site.

---

A Custom Page can contain HTML and BBCodes or pure Text.

You can use each Customized Page as a section for your specific content, making your PHPFusion content modularized and easy to edit when necessary with either TinyMCE or a simple textbox.

## Adding a Custom Page

Page Title: Enter name of Custom Page.

Keywords: You can have SEO friendly Keywords defined for each Custom Page, Type your wanted Keyword and press enter for each keyword you want to insert.

Page Content: Your Custom Page content goes here.

If you have TinyMCE Enabled under Administration > Settings > Miscellaneous Settings >TinyMCE Editor , You will be able to see a button to activate it here in the Custom Pages as well.

We have this extra measure as a precaution for site owners who have PHP codes or HTML customizations in various Custom Page sections. If TinyMCE would automatically enable the codeÂ´s could be scrambled. This feature gives you a free choice of edit mode for each Custom Page.
