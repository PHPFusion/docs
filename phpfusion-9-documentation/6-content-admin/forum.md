# Forum

The Forum system can provide you with a rock solid Forum that is ready to be customized for your needs.

You can have a functional Forum up and running with one Main Forum category by the help of a few mouse clicks.

You can assign Moderators with Access levels either on a User level or set by the native User Group functions of PHPFusion.

You can have as many or as few Forums or your site as you like.

First you need to make sure that you have installed the Infusion we call Forum in your system.

This is done from Administration > System Admin > Infusions > Infuse Forum
