# Versioning

How the PHPFusion versioning works.

---

Our versioning is not that complex as it may seem to be at a first glance.

PHPFusion have 3 steps with more than enough possibilities for our needs.

In PHPFusion 8 we have - 8.00.90,

The 8 is the branch version.

The .00 is the Major version within the 8 branch.

The .90 is a Lesser version within the 8 branch.

A Branch version contains many significant features and functions not seen in the previous branch.

A lot of documentation will be required for all the new features and functions introduced.

A Major version can contain larger functional changes that may have an impact on the system, and it's way to handle things. A Major upgrade may require that you also have some basic knowledge of the changes made, in order to make a safe transition from your previous version.

A Lesser version is not allowed to have any structural or functional changes. The upgrade need to be fairly simple.
